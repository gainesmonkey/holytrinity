# **App Name**: TrinityGen

## Core Features:

- Interactive Chat UI: Provide a real-time chat interface for interacting with Trinity, featuring code syntax highlighting.
- AI-Powered Instruction Processing: Leverage Gemini 2.0 Flash to interpret instructions and generate responses for self-modification. This tool uses contextual reasoning to incorporate specific pieces of information for improvement.
- Sandboxed Code Execution: Implement a sandboxed environment to safely execute code changes generated by Trinity, preventing unintended system disruptions.
- Automated Backup & Version Control: Automatically create code backups before applying self-modifications and implement version control for easy rollback.
- System Monitoring Dashboard: Incorporate system monitoring to track health, performance metrics, and resource usage (CPU, memory, storage).
- Automatic Error Rollback: Automatically revert to the previous stable version in case of failed code changes to maintain system stability.
- Persistent Learning System: Retain a memory of past conversations, decisions, and improvements made to refine Trinity's future self-modification strategies. The model incorporates this information to produce accurate and safe code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to represent intelligence and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#7B1FA2) to highlight important UI elements and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and highly readable interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use minimalistic icons with a focus on clarity and functionality. The icons should be related to AI, development, and system status.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and confirmation animations.
